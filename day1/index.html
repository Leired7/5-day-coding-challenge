      <h2>We will tell you more about Feathers</h2>

      <blockquote>
        “If ever the difficulties of your life seem overwhelming, consider the
        prospect of being eaten alive by savage penguins and rejoice that such
        horrors are unknown to you.” A.L. Kennedy
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Feathers, like majority of her family and relatives, lives in the
        Southern Hemisphere. That is why your chances to be eaten alive by her
        are not that high. Feathers leads an ordinary penguin life at first
        sight. If you read about the penguins, you find information like:
        "aquatic flightless birds", "adapted for life in the water", "feed on
        fish" and so on. However, Feathers is different❕ That is why she has a
        whole website for herself!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Feathers <b>can actually fly</b>. She was extremely determined to
          learn this new skill and she did it!
        </li>
        <li>
          Not only Feathers is adapted to life in water, she has also
          <b>won the "Swim alongside Patagonia 2020" marathon</b> where 267,367
          penguins participated!
        </li>
        <li>
          Feathers goes <b>vegan one day a week</b> to maintain her healthy
          life-style.
